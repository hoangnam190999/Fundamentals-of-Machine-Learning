# Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning
## A simple project to practice machine learning materials (with python)

### 1. Some easy places to get data include:

[Citrination](https://citrination.com). You will need to make an account. Probably want to use API's to get a useful amount of data.

[Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org). Same deal. You will need to make an account. Again, you will probably want to use API's to get a useful amount of data.

[Aflow](https://aflowlib.org). Just need to search for the property you want. Data is retruned in html table. This can easily be copied into excel.

[Matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/). "Matminer is a Python library for data mining the properties of materials". A small bit of python will give you quick access to Citrination and Materials Project data as well as select data from individual publications.

Literature.

### 2. Clean the data
